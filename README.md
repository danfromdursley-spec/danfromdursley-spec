# Quantum Design Systems (QDS)

Hi, I’m Dan – building **physics-inspired tools** almost entirely on an Android phone with AI assistance.

**Current focus (3 pillars)**

- 🔋 **QDS Battery Whisperer** – phone-safe demo for battery stress, ageing & correlated noise
- 📈 **QDSX Market Edition** – data compression & stress-testing for noisy market signals
- 🌐 **UV-QDS + Phone Dev Lab** – mobile-first QDS lab: 0 → 250+ tools built on a phone
- 🧬 **Oxford-Village Language Engine** – experimental proto-root & script exploration

Most of this work underpins applied R&D I’m discussing with **UKRI**, local **Growth Hub** and industry partners.
