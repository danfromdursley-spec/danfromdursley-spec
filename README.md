# Quantum Design Systems (QDS)

Hi, I’m Dan – building QDS: physics-inspired tools developed almost entirely on an Android phone with AI assistance.

**Current focus**

- 🔋 **QDS Battery Whisperer** – demo for battery stress & ageing, phone-safe  
- 🌐 **UV-QDS** – mobile hub for QDS experiments  
- 📈 **QDSX Market Edition** – physics-inspired synthetic data engine  
- 📱 **Phone–ChatGPT Dev Lab** – case study: 0 → 250+ tools on a phone  

Most of this work underpins applications I’m discussing with UKRI, local Growth Hub and industry partners.
